# PracticumProjects

My repository of projects I felt were my best work during the bootcamp.

| Project name | Description | Libraries used |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
|[Taxi Orders Model](taxi_orders)| Utilizing historical data on taxi orders at airports to create a model that predicts the amount of taxi orders for any given time frame. | *pandas, statsmodels.tsa.seasonal, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, lightgbm* |
|[Movie Review Sentiment Analysis](movie_review)| Training a model to automatically detect negative reviews for a system used to filter and categorize movie reviews. | *math, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm* |
|[Grocery Chain Model](grocery_chain)| Training and evaluating a model to automatically detect the age of a customer at a checkout counter. | *pandas, tensorflow, PIL, glob, numpy, matplotlib.py* |
|[Steel Processing Project](steel_processing)| Optimizing production costs by reducing energy consumption through analyzing historical data from the different stages of steel processing, and creating a model from the consolidated data that can predict the final temperature of finished steel. | *pandas, numpy, sklearn, lightgbm* |

*Projects are listed in the order that they were completed.*
